- To explore, sort and analyse mega data from various sources to take advantage of them and reach conclusions to optimize business processes and for decision support.
  
<h1 align="left"> Introduction about Data Science

 - Data  Science  as  a  multi-disciplinary  subject  that  uses mathematics,  statistics,  and computer science to study and evaluate data. The key objective of Data Science is to  extract valuable information  for  use  in  strategic  decision  making,  product  development,  trend  analysis,  and forecasting
 - Data  Science  concepts  and  processes  are  mostly  derived  from  data  engineering,  statistics, programming, social engineering, data warehousing, machine learning, and natural language processing. The key techniques in use are data mining, big data analysis, data extraction and data retrieval.

<h1 align="left"> Data Science Process:

1. The first step of this process is setting a research goal. The main purpose here is making sure all the stakeholders understand the what, how, and why of the project.
2. The second phase is data retrieval. You want to have data available for analysis, so this step includes finding suitable data and getting access to the data from the data owner. The result is data in its raw form, which probably needs polishing and transformation before it becomes usable.
3. Now that you have the raw data, it’s time to prepare it. This includes transforming the data from a raw form into data that’s directly usable in your models. To achieve this, you’ll detect and correct different kinds of errors in the data, combine data from different data  sources,  and  transform  it.  If  you  have  successfully  completed  this  step,  you can progress to data visualization and modeling.
4. The fourth step is data exploration. The goal of this step is to gain a deep understanding of the  data. You’ll look  for patterns, correlations, and deviations based  on visual and descriptive techniques. The insights you gain from  this phase  will enable you to start modeling.
5. Finally, we get to the sexiest part: model building (often referred to as “data modeling” throughout  this  book).  It  is  now  that  you  attempt  to  gain  the  insights  or  make  the predictions stated in your project charter. Now is the time to bring out the heavy guns, but remember research has taught us that often (but not always) a combination of simple models  tends  to  outperform  one  complicated  model.  If  you’ve  done  this  phase  right, you’re almost done.
6. The last step of the data science model is presenting your results and automating the analysis,  if  needed.  One  goal  of  a  project  is  to  change  a  process  and/or  make  better decisions. You may still need  to  convince the  business that your findings will indeed change the business process as expected. This is where you can shine in your influencer role. The importance of this step is more apparent in projects on a strategic and tactical level. Certain projects require you to perform the business process over and over again, so automating the project will save time. 

<h1 align="left">  Reason for choosing data science


Data Science has become a revolutionary technology that everyone seems to talk about.  Data Science is a buzzword with very few people knowing about the technology in its true sense. While many people wish to become Data Scientists, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons of data science and give out a real picture. In this article, we will discuss these points in detail and provide you with the necessary insights about Data Science.

Advantages: 
1. It’s in Demand
2. Abundance of Positions
3. A Highly Paid Career
4. Data Science is Versatile 

Disadvantages: 
1. Mastering Data Science is near to impossible
2. A large Amount of Domain Knowledge Required
3. Arbitrary Data May Yield Unexpected Results
4. The problem of Data Privacy.
